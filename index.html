   <h1>This page is made for an assignment, and today I will be talking about one person that was significant, and helped give contribution to Computer Science and what is learned in there.</h1>
   The one person I will be talking about is Roy Clay Sr. 
   I will answer some questions about him.
   <ul>
     <li>What problem did he help solve?</li> The problem that Roy Clay Sr. helped solve was the lack of diversity in the technology industry. He worked to create opportunities for underrepresented groups, particularly African Americans, in the field of computer science and technology.
     <li>What technology did he work on?</li> Roy Clay Sr. worked on various technologies throughout his career, including early computer systems and software development. He was involved in the development of the first computer systems at Hewlett-Packard and later contributed to the growth of Silicon Valley's tech industry.
     <li>Why does his work still matter?</li> Roy Clay Sr.'s work still matters because it paved the way for greater diversity and inclusion in the technology industry. His efforts to create opportunities for underrepresented groups have had a lasting impact on the industry, helping to foster innovation and creativity by bringing in diverse perspectives and talents.
   </ul>
    <h3>Here are three important facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Roy Clay Sr. was born in 1929 in Arkansas and later moved to California, where he became a prominent figure in the tech industry.</li>
      <li>He was one of the first African Americans to work at Hewlett-Packard, where he played a key role in the development of early computer systems.</li>
      <li>Roy Clay Sr. also founded his own company, ROD-L Electronics, which focused on developing technology for the aerospace industry.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Here is one major achievement or invention he has had</h3>
     One major achievement of Roy Clay Sr. was his role in the development of the first computer systems at Hewlett-Packard. He was instrumental in designing and building early computer hardware, which laid the foundation for the growth of the tech industry in Silicon Valley. His contributions helped to establish Hewlett-Packard as a major player in the technology sector and paved the way for future innovations in computing.
    <h3>Here is how his work connects to something I am learning in Web Design</h3>
    Roy Clay Sr.'s work connects to web design in that his contributions to the development of early computer systems and software have had a lasting impact on the technology industry, including the field of web design. The advancements in computing and technology that he helped to pioneer have enabled the creation of more sophisticated and user-friendly web design tools and platforms. Additionally, his efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the tech industry have helped to foster a more inclusive environment for web designers and developers, allowing for a wider range of perspectives and ideas to be incorporated into web design practices.
    In this connection, I am also working on website designing, and learning many many things.
